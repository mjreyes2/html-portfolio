  <h1>The Best Movies According to Marvin</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Mist</h3>

<p>This is my top favorite. It's a cool psychological horror movie.</p>

<h3>Terminator: Dark Fate</h3>

<p>This is a cool sci-fi movie that has several sequels. The first movie I saw was Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Later, I watched the original movie called The Terminator. After that one, I watched Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Terminator Salvation, and lastly Terminator Genisys. </p>

<h3>1492: Conquest of Paradise</h3>

<p>This is a historical drama movie. I watched this during my undergrad. It's about Christopher Columbus, and his interactions with the indigenous people.</p>
