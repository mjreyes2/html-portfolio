  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Marvin, and I’m learning to become a developer. I have always been interested in technology and how it can make our lives better and easier. However, I never pursued this passion until recently, when I decided to take the leap and get into tech. I realized that this is the field where I can express my creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving skills.</p>
  <p>I’m interested in web development, artificial intelligence, programming, and app development. I’m rather new to these topics, but I’m eager to learn more and improve my skills. I enjoy creating websites that are user-friendly, responsive, and attractive. I’m fascinated by artificial intelligence and how it can enhance various domains such as education, health, entertainment, and more. I love programming and experimenting with different languages, frameworks, and tools. I also want to get into app development and create mobile applications that can reach a wider audience and provide value.</p>
  <p>I understand that technology is a rapidly growing field and that as professionals we have to do our own research and learn ways to perfect our craft. That’s why I love to learn and keep myself updated with the latest trends and innovations. I can see myself learning new ways to improve myself and get better at what I do. I’m always open to feedback, challenges, and opportunities. I’m looking forward to collaborating with other developers and working on exciting projects.</p>
